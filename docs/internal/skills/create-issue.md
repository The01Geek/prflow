# `/prflow:create-issue`

This page explains how the issue-shaping skill grounds a proposed change in the repository before asking the user to approve an issue.

## Current behavior

The skill starts with a rough user story or bug report. Its first investigation dispatches `/prflow:docs-verify --report-only` peers over the internal documentation and the rest of the tracked tree, using the resolved internal-doc path as the documentation search-space leg. The findings are captured before clarification or drafting continues.

The skill then clarifies the Definition of Ready, independently expands the solution space, drafts the issue, steelmans the draft against the code, runs a fresh-context audit, shows the complete draft to the user, and creates the issue only after explicit approval.

The documentation pass is a code-exploration input. It reports how the topic works today and exposes unestablished duties; it does not treat existing prose as authoritative or edit the repository in report-only mode.

## Why it works this way

Agents plan better when they begin with the repository's current behavior rather than the user's proposed mechanism or stale documentation. The two search-space legs keep internal documentation discovery separate from code discovery while preserving a path from each documented claim to its implementation.

## Boundaries and failure paths

- A docs-verify peer must finish and return its structured findings before clarification begins.
- A missing or unreadable internal-doc population is reported as unestablished, not silently treated as no documentation.
- A report-only peer does not write, commit, push, or dispatch another peer.
- A documentation claim that cannot be confirmed against code remains unconfirmed in the findings and cannot be promoted into the issue as fact.
